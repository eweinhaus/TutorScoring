# Tutor Quality Scoring System

## Project Overview

Create an automated system that evaluates tutor performance across every session, identifies coaching opportunities, predicts which tutors will churn, and recommends interventions.

**Key Performance Requirements:**
- Process 3,000 daily sessions
- Provide actionable insights within 1 hour of session completion

## Retention Enhancement Requirements

The system must address critical retention issues:

- **Poor First Session Experiences**
  - Detect patterns leading to poor first session experiences
  - 24% of churners fail at this stage

- **High Rescheduling Rates**
  - Flag tutors with high rescheduling rates
  - 98.2% of reschedules are tutor-initiated

- **No-Show Risk**
  - Identify tutors at risk of no-shows
  - 16% of tutor replacements are due to no-shows

## Sprint Requirements

### Constraints

- Must include working demo, not just designs
- Solution must integrate with existing Rails/React platform

## Deliverables

- Working prototype deployed to cloud (AWS or Vercel)
- Documentation of AI tools used and prompting strategies
- 5-minute demo video showing actual functionality
- Cost analysis for production deployment
- 90-day roadmap for full implementation

## Success Metrics

- Does it solve a real business problem?
- Could this ship to production within 2 weeks?
- Does it leverage AI in sophisticated ways?
- Clear path to ROI within 90 days?
