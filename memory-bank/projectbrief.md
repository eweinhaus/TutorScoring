# Project Brief
## Tutor Quality Scoring System

**Project Type:** Take-Home Interview Project / AI-First Software Engineering  
**Status:** Planning Complete, Ready for Implementation  
**Target:** MVP for Job Interview Demo

---

## Core Purpose

Build an automated system that evaluates tutor performance across every session, identifies coaching opportunities, predicts which tutors will churn, and recommends interventions. This is a take-home project for an AI-first software engineer interview, designed to demonstrate technical capability, AI sophistication, and production-readiness.

## Key Requirements

### Performance Requirements
- **Scale:** Process 3,000 daily sessions
- **Latency:** Provide actionable insights within 1 hour of session completion
- **Throughput:** Handle peak loads (~125 sessions/hour)

### Retention Enhancement Requirements

The system must address three critical retention issues:

1. **Poor First Session Experiences**
   - 24% of churners fail at this stage
   - Detect patterns leading to poor first session experiences
   - **MVP Status:** Out of scope (Phase 3)

2. **High Rescheduling Rates**
   - 98.2% of reschedules are tutor-initiated
   - Flag tutors with high rescheduling rates
   - **MVP Status:** ✅ Core feature

3. **No-Show Risk**
   - 16% of tutor replacements are due to no-shows
   - Identify tutors at risk of no-shows
   - **MVP Status:** Out of scope (Phase 2)

---

## MVP Scope

### In Scope
1. **Reschedule Rate Flagging** - Calculate and flag tutors with >15% reschedule rate
2. **Dashboard Interface** - React dashboard with tutor list and detail views
3. **Automated Email Reports** - Per-session reports sent to administrators
4. **Session Processing Pipeline** - Async processing with Celery workers
5. **Synthetic Data Generation** - Realistic test data for demo

### Out of Scope (Future Phases)
- AI-powered pattern analysis (Phase 2)
- No-show risk prediction (Phase 2)
- First session quality scoring (Phase 3)
- Real Rails integration (Production - MVP uses mock)
- Real-time alerts (Future)

---

## Deliverables

1. **Working Prototype** - Deployed to cloud (Render for MVP, AWS-ready)
2. **Documentation** - AI tools used and prompting strategies
3. **Demo Video** - 5-minute demonstration of functionality
4. **Cost Analysis** - Production deployment cost estimates
5. **Roadmap** - 90-day implementation plan

---

## Success Criteria

### Technical
- Does it solve a real business problem?
- Could this ship to production within 2 weeks?
- Does it leverage AI in sophisticated ways?
- Clear path to ROI within 90 days?

### MVP-Specific
- Processes 3,000 sessions/day successfully
- 1-hour processing latency maintained
- Identifies high-reschedule tutors accurately
- Clean, intuitive dashboard
- Demo-ready system

---

## Project Context

This is a **take-home project** for an AI-first software engineer interview. The project is intentionally open-ended to allow demonstration of:
- Technical architecture and design
- AI/ML integration capabilities
- Production-ready code quality
- Problem-solving approach
- Business value understanding

---

## Constraints

- Must include working demo (not just designs)
- Solution must integrate with existing Rails/React platform
- Must be deployable to cloud (AWS or Render)
- Must demonstrate AI sophistication
- Must show clear production path

---

## Key Decisions

1. **AI Provider:** OpenAI API (not Gemini - per user preference)
2. **Deployment:** Render for MVP, AWS for production
3. **MVP Focus:** Reschedule rate flagging (simple, measurable, valuable)
4. **Architecture:** FastAPI backend, React frontend, Celery workers
5. **Data:** Synthetic data generation for demo

---

## Timeline

- **Planning:** Complete ✅
- **MVP Development:** Weeks 1-2 (target)
- **Demo Preparation:** Week 2
- **Future Phases:** 90-day roadmap defined

---

## Project Status

**Current Phase:** Planning Complete, Ready for Implementation  
**Next Steps:** Begin Environment Setup (PRD_Environment_Setup.md)

All planning documents are in `/planning/` directory:
- `PRD_MVP.md` - Main product requirements
- `PRDs/` - Sub-PRDs for each phase
- `roadmap.md` - Future phases
- `architecture/` - System architecture
